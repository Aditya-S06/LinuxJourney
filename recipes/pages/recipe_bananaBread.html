        This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana<br>
        flavor. Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's<br>
        by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!<br>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
            <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>How to Make Banana Bread</h3>
        You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect <br>when you make this simple banana bread:
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Make Banana Bread Moist</h3>
        This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar (which adds more moisture than white sugar).<br> Plus, mashed bananas have plenty of moisture on their own. Make sure you store the banana bread properly to keep it moist for several days.

        <h3>How Long to Bake Banana Bread</h3>
        This banana bread recipe should be perfectly baked after about an hour in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. <br>You'll know it's done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.<br> Make sure you let the bread sit in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out. Otherwise, it might not stay in one piece.
