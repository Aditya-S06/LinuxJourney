        There's nothing quite like a hot, fresh pizza made right in your own kitchen.<br>
        This homemade pizza recipe yields a crispy, chewy crust topped with your favorite<br>
        sauce and cheese. It's better than delivery and fun to make!<br>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Toppings of choice (pepperoni, vegetables, basil, etc.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Make Homemade Pizza</h3>
        Making pizza from scratch is easier than you think. Here is a brief overview of the process:
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until creamy.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, and oil. Add the yeast mixture and knead until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and stretch into a circle on a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Top with sauce, cheese, and desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for 10-15 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Best Flour for Pizza Dough</h3>
        While all-purpose flour works well, using bread flour will give your crust a chewier texture and better structure. If you want an even crispier crust, you can try '00' flour, which is finely ground and traditional for Italian pizzas.

        <h3>Baking Tips for the Perfect Crust</h3>
        For the best results, preheat your oven as high as it will go (usually 475°F-500°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats. The high heat is crucial for getting that pizzeria-style crust—crispy on the outside and airy on the inside.
