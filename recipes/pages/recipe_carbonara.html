        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti or rigatoni</li>
            <li>4 ounces guanciale or pancetta, cubed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs plus 2 large yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Make Carbonara</h3>
        Here is a brief overview of how to make this classic Italian dish:
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
            <li>While pasta cooks, sauté guanciale or pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, yolks, and grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Add cooked pasta to the skillet with the pork and toss to coat. Remove pan from heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. Add pasta water if needed.</li>
            <li>Season generously with black pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Secret to Creamy Carbonara</h3>
        The key to a silky sauce is temperature control. You must remove the pan from the heat before adding the egg mixture. The residual heat from the pasta and fat cooks the eggs gently, creating a creamy emulsion rather than scrambled eggs.

        <h3>Which Cheese to Use</h3>
        Traditionally, Carbonara is made with Pecorino Romano, a sheep's milk cheese that is sharp and salty. If you find the flavor too strong, you can substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano or use a mix of both cheeses.
